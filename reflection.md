Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
    You have to be able to explain in detail and words what you want each class to do and how you want each class to relate to each other. Then you can figure out how to do that.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Reading and re-reading the instructions carefully helped. I would advise testing your methods in each class thoroughly first before moving on to create methods in another class.
